# Malware-Detection-API
## AWS-based Deep Learning PE Malware Detection Classifier

This project aims to detect malware in Portable Executable (PE) files using the MalConv architecture and deploy the model on AWS SageMaker for real-time inference. The model is trained on the EMBER dataset and attempted to be deployed as a cloud API accessible via an endpoint. This project employs the PyTorch framework. For training an **ml.r5.xlarge** SageMaker notebook instance has been used. 

- The **S24_AISec_Midterm_Training_v1.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook contains the code for dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The architecture is built from scratch. 

- The **Inference-deployment-v1.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook includes code for inference and deployment to AWS SageMaker endpoint.

- **model_epoch_13.pt** is the final model checkpoint from training. 

- The *model* folder contains the best model and inference script for deployment.

- A comprehensive report detailing the project is also available here.
